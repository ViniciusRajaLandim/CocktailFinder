# :computer: Technologies

This project was made using the following technologies:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)

# :computer: Used Libraries

This project was made using the following Libraries:

- [react-native-linear-gradient](https://github.com/react-native-linear-gradient/react-native-linear-gradient): Used to Create linear gradients, more specifically in the CocktailsCardItem component
- [react-native-fast-image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image): Used to achieve a better performance in loading multiple images inside CocktailsList(Flatlist) component.
- [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen): Used to creat Apps Splashscreen.
- [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons): Library of Icons.
- [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk): Redux Middleware used to write async logic(fetch cocktails from api) that interacts with the Redux store.

# :computer: Improvements

Improvements that could be implemented in case there was a Large List of items:

- Add pagination to fetch request
- Load cocktails items accordingly to the pagination using FlatList properties such as onEndReached, onEndReachedThreshold to load more items only when getting close to the end of the list.

- Also, could be used some Flatlist properties to increase performance as suggested in the official docs, such as:
  - maxToRenderPerBatch (will limit the number of items rendered per scroll, updateCellsBatchingPeriod (determine the period of reloads per scroll)
  - getItemLayout used to remove the need for FlatList to manage async layout calculations, but can only be used if all the items have the same width or height;
  - windowSize (used to specify the number of viewports loaded, the default value is 21, should choose the best fitting value based on the number of items per viewport).

# :rocket: Features
